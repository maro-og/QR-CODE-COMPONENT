## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

In the course of this project, I learned how to properly center a div and also how important the use of CSS variables is to simplify one's design experience. 




### Continued development

For fututre projects and challenges, i'd like to know more on Media Queries (when and where to utilize it, properties and property values that are suitable for select screen types).

Also, looking forward to learning the aspect of widths and heights, knowing when to use width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height and max-height seeing that these properties are important to every developer and their design.

Finally, as I continue with more challenges, improve in the aspect of timing as this is an integral part of many design processes.
